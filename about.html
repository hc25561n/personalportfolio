              Since my Freshman year of college, I have been on Pace
              University's Esports team on Dinaco Blue. Serving as a Team
              Captain as my team, leading us to place 3rd place regionally in
              our division.

              Being in NYC opens a multitude of new cuisines to experience and
              eat. One of my favorite things to do in NYC is trying different
              foods from around the world to gain deeper appreciation into
              countries cultures.

              I really enjoy clothing and being able to express yourself through
              how you dress. What's important, however, is to remember to be
              mindful of our planet too. That is why I have modeled for a
              up-cycling, vintage, clothing company called "Sleep Thirsty" to
              find old clothes a new home.
